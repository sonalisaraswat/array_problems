 Groups come one by one and line up behind the already present queue. The groups have a strange way of arranging themselves. In a particular group, the group members arrange themselves in increasing order of their height(not necessarily strictly increasing).
Swapy observes a long queue standing in front of the ATM near his house. Being a curious kid, he wants to count the total number of groups present in the queue waiting to withdraw money.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int n,x,y,c=1,l;
cin>>n;
cin>>x;
for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
{
    cin>>y;
    if(x>y)
        c++;
        x=y;
}
cout<<endl<<c<<endl;
return 0;
}
